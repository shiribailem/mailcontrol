#Mail Control#
__Version 0.3__
__Unstable__


Somewhat stable version of code... still lacking in documentation

Requires sqlalchemy, imapclient, and requests. All included in setup.py. Database modules are not included.

Config files are loaded from one of the following (in order of priority):

* ./mailcontrols.ini (config ini only)
* current working directory
* ~/.mailcontrols/ (recommended)
* /etc/mailcontrols/
* ~\AppData\Roaming\mailcontrols\
* C:\mailcontrols\

Two config files are used: config.ini and filterst.txt

Examples configuration files can be found in the mailcontrols/examples directory

Database settings are passed to the sqlalchemy connect statement in parts.
Type is the sqlalchemy connector.
Other components are the typical expected options.

No database templates are necessary, plugins load table descriptions in their initialization,
sqlalchemy then creates tables in response.

Filters are loaded from filters.txt by filename (without extension) and filters are applied in the order listed.

The following locations are searched for filters, in order:

* ~/.mailcontrols/filters/
* /var/lib/mailcontrols/filters/ (recommended for additional filters)
* /etc/mailcontrols/filters/
* ~\AppData\Roaming\mailcontrols\filters\
* C:\mailcontrols\filters\
* built in filters

Filter plugins store configuration information in the database, details are present in the individual modules.
